# [Repository Name] - Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch

![Project Image](insert_project_image_url_here)

## Overview

This project is a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and train a fully connected neural network using PyTorch to accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9).

## Project Files

- [Jupyter Notebook](notebook.ipynb): Contains the code for the project.
- [Model Weights](model_weights.pth): Pre-trained model weights.
- [MNIST Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#mnist): You can download the dataset using PyTorch's torchvision library.
